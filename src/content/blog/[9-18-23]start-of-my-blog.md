## Introduction
To whomever is reading this,  welcome to my blog.

I'm sure information about me will be on my "About" page, but nevertheless, Hi, I'm David, a second year Computer Engineering student as of writing this post. I don't plan to use this as a traditional blog, but more as a place for technical documentation for personal projects and such. Hardly anyone really reads real blogs nowadays anyways.

I decided to create this blog after much blind scrambling, working on my disorganized full stack project. It took me far too long to realize that I should lay out a much more solid, structured plan for my project to reduce research time, as well as time waste. One of my first blog posts will likely be about that project. Better late than never I guess.

That's pretty much it for this post, I hope to continue this blog for my own sake if not for anyone else's.

Signing off, David
